\begin{frame}{Introduction}
 \begin{itemize}
        \item We studied Nash equilibrium and its properties for various finite games. 
        \item Nash (1950) proves that every finite player finite-strategy game has a Nash equilibrium, and since it is self-enforcing, it is a key solution concept used by game theorists. 
        \item Today, we are going to see Nash equilibrium applications in games where each player has infinitely many strategies to play. 
        \item The classical examples are monopolistic competition and oligopolistic competition. 
        \item Suggested Reading: Tadelis, "Game Theory",  pages 83-95.
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Perfect Competition World}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In microeconomics theory, the underlying assumption is perfect competition. 
    \item There exists perfectly competitive markets, where consumers meet their demands, and firms supply their output. 
    \item Consider inverse consumer demand with $p(q)=100-q$, if $q<100$, and $p(q)=0$ if $q\geq 100$. Firms do not have fixed cost, and their variable cost is $c(q)=cq$. 
    \item In perfect competition world, the price will be equal
    \begin{equation*}
        p^{CE}=c,
    \end{equation*}
    and the quantity produced in the economy is
    \begin{equation*}
        q^{CE}=100-c.
    \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Perfect Competition World}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perfect competition theory is a foundation for modeling firm behavior, it gives a very good intuition, and it is widely used. 
    \item However, it is far from being realistic. 
    \item Assumptions are that goods are identical, consumers are identical, and firms produce identical products. 
    \item The key assumptions that we discuss today is that there are infinitely many firms who have zero market power, cannot affect demand and price. 
    \item Today, we discuss the case when there are finitely many firms competing. It  is called \textbf{Monopolistic Competition} when a single firm produces the good, and \textbf{Oligopolistic Competition } when multiple. 
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Monopolistic Competition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assume there is a single firm producing an output q, with a variable cost $c(q)=cq$. 
    
    \item  Inverse consumer demand is $p(q)=100-q$, if $q<100$, and $p(q)=0$ if $q\geq 100$.
\item Firm is profit maximizing, and it has market power over both price and quantity. 
\item Firm's profit is: 
\[\pi(q)= p(q)\times q-cq=(100-q)q-cq.
\]

\end{itemize}
 
    \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Monopolistic Competition}
Firm will choose output $q$ such that 
\[\max_{q}(100-q)q-cq
\]
\textbf{FOC:} $ 100-q-q-c=0$. And therefore, $q^M=\frac{100-c}{2}$.
\par
Notice that \[ q^{CE}=100-c > q^M =\frac{100-c}{2}.\]

In monopolistic competition price is higher than in Competitive markets:
\[p^M>p^{CE}.
\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Oligopolistic Competition: Cournot Duopoly}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If there are more than one firms in the economy, then there is a competition between those firms. 
    \item The assumption is that firms are producing identical output. 
    \item However, there are two types of competition: price or quantity. 
    \item When firms compete on price, we call it Bertrand Competition. When competition is on quantity produced, we call it Cournot Competition. 
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Oligopolistic Competition: Cournot Duopoly}

    Consider Cournot Duopoly example with demand $p(q)=100-q$, if $q<100$, and $p(q)=0$ if $q\geq 100$, and $q=q_1+q_2$. The costs of both firms are $c_1(q_1)=cq_1$, $c_2(q_2)=cq_2$. Firms are competing on quantity.

\par
Consider the  profit function of firm 1:
\[\pi_1(q_1,q_2)=(100-q_1-q_2)q_1-cq_1= 100 q_1-q_1^2-q_1q_2- cq_1.
\]
If firm 2 chooses to produce $q_2$ amount, then firm 1 would choose $q_1$ that maximizes profits. Firm 1 solves, 
\[\max_{q_1}100q_1-q_1^2-q_1q_2-cq_1.
\]
FOC: $100-2q_1-q_2-c=0$. 


Therefore the best response is solving first order condition. 
\[q_1=\frac{100-q_2-c}{2}.
\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Oligopolistic Competition: Cournot Duopoly}

 

\par
Let's consider the  profit function of firm 2:
\[\pi_2(q_1,q_2)=(100-q_1-q_2)q_2-cq_2= 100 q_2-q_1q_2-q_2^2- cq_2.
\]
If firm 1 chooses to produce $q_1$ amount, then firm 2 would choose $q_2$ that maximizes profits. Firm 2 solves, 
\[\max_{q_2}100q_2-q_2^2-q_1q_2-cq_2.
\]
FOC: $100-2q_2-q_1-c=0$. 


Therefore the best response is solving first order condition. 
\[q_2=\frac{100-q_1-c}{2}.
\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Oligopolistic Competition: Cournot Duopoly}
The best response of firm 1 is
\[q_1=\frac{100-q_2-c}{2}.
\]
and the best response of firm 2 is
\[q_2=\frac{100-q_1-c}{2}.
\]
To find Nash equilibrium, we need to solve the system of equations with $q_1$ and $q_2$. 
\[\begin{cases}q_1=\frac{100-q_2-c}{2}, \\ q_2=\frac{100-q_1-c}{2}.

\end{cases}
\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Oligopolistic Competition: Cournot Duopoly}
\[\begin{cases}q_1=\frac{100-q_2-c}{2}, \\ q_2=\frac{100-q_1-c}{2}.

\end{cases}
\] 
Plus the value of $q_2$ into the equation of $q_1$:
\[q_1=\frac{100-q_2-c}{2}=\frac{100-\frac{100-q_1-c}{2}-c}{2}=25+\frac{q_1}{4}-\frac{c}{4}.
\]
Solving, we have
\[ q_1^{CD}=\frac{100-c}{3}. 
\]
\[ q_2^{CD}=\frac{100-c}{3}. 
\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Oligopolistic Competition: Cournot Duopoly}
The total output produced in this economy is:
\[Q^{CD}= q_1^{CD}+q_2^{CD}=\frac{100-c}{3}+\frac{100-c}{3}=\frac{2}{3}(100-c). 
\]
Notice the following inequalities:
\[ q^{CE}=100-c > Q^{CD}=\frac{2}{3}(100-c)>  q^M =\frac{100-c}{2}.\]
Cournot Duopoly produces less output then perfect competition economy, however, it produces more than monopoly. Similarly,

\[p^M>p^{CD}>p^{CE}.
\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Oligopolistic Competition: Cournot Duopoly}
\[ q^{CE}> Q^{CD}>  q^M .\]

\[p^M>p^{CD}>p^{CE}.
\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consumers are better of with more competition. 
    \item As you can tell, when we added second firm, the output went up, and price went down. This is a result of two firms competing against each other. 
    \item Cournot (1838) anticipated firms to play Nash equilibrium. Cournot competition theory is one of the cornerstones of the theory of industrial organization. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Oligopolistic Competition: Cournot Oligopoly}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In general, when there are $n$-firms, the quantity produced by each firm is:
    \[q^{CO}=\frac{1}{n+1}(100-c),
    \]
    \item The total output in the economy is 
    \[Q^{CO}=\frac{n}{n+1}(100-c).
    \]
    \item The more firms there are, the higher is the output produced, and the lower prices. 
    \item More generally, when the number of firms tends to infinity, Cournot outcome becomes competitive. 
    \[ \lim Q^{CO}=\frac{n}{n+1}(100-c)\rightarrow  (100-c)=q^{CE}, \text{ as } n\rightarrow \infty.
    \]

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Cournot model assumed that the firms choose quantities and the market price comes from consumer demand. 
    \item Bertrand (1883) argue that firms often set prices and consumers choose from where they will purchase based on prices. 
    \item Firms produce identical goods, and each firm posts a price. 
    \item Consumers buy from the firm that offers lowest price.

\begin{frame}{Bertrand Duopoly}
Assume that the inverse demand is given by $p=100-q$, and cost functions are $c_i(q_i)=cq_i$. Consumers buy from the firm whose price is the lowest. In case of a tie, market splits equally between two firms.

The normal-form representation of the game:
 \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Players:} $N=\{1,2\}$.
        \item \textbf{Actions:} $S_1=S_2=[0,\infty)$, and firms choose prices $p_1$, $p_2$.
        \item Given our assumption, the quantities are given: 
        $$q_1(p_1,p_2)=\begin{cases} 100-p_1, & \text{ if } p_1<p_2,  \\
        0 , & \text{ if }p_1>p_2, \\
        \frac{100-p_1}{2}, & \text{ if } p_1=p_2.

         $$q_2(p_1,p_2)=\begin{cases} 100-p_2, & \text{ if } p_2<p_1,  \\

        \frac{100-p_2}{2}, & \text{ if } p_1=p_2.
        \end{cases}$$
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Bertrand Duopoly}

 \begin{enumerate}
       \item Therefore, the profit of each firm will be
        $$\pi_1(p_1,p_2)=\begin{cases} (100-p_1)(p_1-c), & \text{ if } p_1<p_2,  \\
        0 , & \text{ if }p_1>p_2, \\
        \frac{100-p_1}{2}(p_1-c), & \text{ if } p_1=p_2.
        \end{cases}$$
         $$\pi_2(p_1,p_2)=\begin{cases} (100-p_2)(p_2-c), & \text{ if } p_2<p_1,  \\
        0 , & \text{ if }p_2>p_1, \\
        \frac{100-p_2}{2}(p_2-c), & \text{ if } p_1=p_2.
        \end{cases}$$
    \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Bertrand Duopoly}
    \begin{block}{Proposition}
    There is a unique Nash equilibrium in this game: $p_1=p_2=c$.
    \end{block}
    \textbf{Proof:} First note that in any equilibrium $p_i\geq c$ for both firms - otherwise firm offering a price lower than c will lose money. We need to show that $p_i>c$ cannot be part of any equilibrium. We can see this in two steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $p_1=p_2=\hat p>c$ then each would benefit from lowering its price to some price $\hat p-\varepsilon$ ($\varepsilon$ very small) and get the whole market for almost the same price.
        \item If $p_1> p_2 \geq c$ then player 2 would want to deviate to $p_1-\varepsilon$ ($\varepsilon$ very small) and earn higher profits. 
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bertrand Duopoly}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It's intuitive why $p_1=p_2=c$ is an equilibrium: Firm $i$'s best response to $p_j=c$ is $p_i(c)\geq c$. 
        \item Any price at or above marginal costs c is a best response to the other player charging c.
        \item Hence, $p_1=p_2=c$ is the equilibrium because each is playing a best response to the other's choice and neither wants to deviate to a different price. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bertrand Duopoly}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Remember that competitive price was $p^{CE}=c$. 
        \item We showed that when firms are competing in prices, then market behaves like in case of perfect competition, prices being $p_1=p_2=c$. 
        \item Note that if we add third, fourth or many firms this will not change the outcome, the prices still will be $c$.
        \item This is not the case for Cournot competition, in which firms manage to obtain some market power as long as the number of firms is not too large. 
        
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 1: Homework}
    \textbf{Competitive Equilibrium}
    \par 
 Remember that in competitive equilibrium we have marginal revenue ($MR$) is equal to marginal cost ($MC$). Firm revenue is equal $p\times q$, and cost is equal  $c(q)=c\times q$. In this case we have that 
\[ MR= p, \text{ and } MC=c. 
\]

Therefore, $p^{CE}=c$. 
\par 
 Now suppose,  inverse consumer demand is $p(q)=250-q$, if $q<250$, and $p(q)=0$ if $q\geq 250$ and variable cost is  $c(q)=20\times q$. Find competitive price ($p^{CE}$) and output ($q^{CE}$). \textbf{Hint:} Use consumer demand function $q(p)$.

 Firm is profit maximizing, and it has market power over both price and quantity.

\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Today, we discussed very important topic: firms competing in economy under different setups. 
\item We saw that the desirable outcome is competitive equilibrium outcome, and it leads to highest output produced, and lowest prices for consumers. 
\item When there was imperfect competition, firms obtained market power and affected prices and output. 
\item When competition was on prices, efficiency restored, however, when it was on quantity, the inefficiency remained. 
  \item  Assignment 2 is due next \textbf{Tuesday, September 28th, 2:00 pm}. \textbf{No late submissions.}
